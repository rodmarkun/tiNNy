TiNNy is a minimalist project aimed at demonstrating the power and potential of neural networks using nothing but Python and Numpy. This project is designed for educational purposes, allowing users to understand the fundamentals of neural network architectures, forward propagation, backpropagation, and training processes in a hands-on manner.

## Getting Started with TiNNy

Start using TiNNy by setting up the project on your personal computer. Follow these simple steps to get started:

### Dive Into Demos

TiNNy comes equipped with two sample Python notebooks. These demos are a great way to see TiNNy in action:

- [demo_classification.ipynb](https://github.com/rodmarkun/tiNNy/blob/master/demo_classification.ipynb): TiNNy classification project using the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.
- [demo_regression.ipynb](https://github.com/rodmarkun/tiNNy/blob/master/demo_regression.ipynb): TiNNy regression project using the Boston housing price dataset.

### Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rodmarkun/tiNNy
cd tiNNy
```

TiNNy requires certain Python packages to function properly. Ensure all dependencies are installed by executing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

With the installation complete, you're ready to incorporate TiNNy into your Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks. Simply import the library using:

```python
import tinny
```

You are now equipped to explore the features and capabilities of TiNNy. Happy coding!
