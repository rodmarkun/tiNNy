# TiNNy: Simple neural networks built from scratch with just Python and Numpy

![ab3c57d8c8851397c82aa3868b60b611](https://github.com/rodmarkun/tiNNy/assets/75074498/d1f93819-5f40-4029-82d1-1bc6938f68b3)


TiNNy is a minimalist project aimed at demonstrating the power and potential of neural networks using nothing but Python and Numpy. This project is designed for educational purposes, allowing users to understand the fundamentals of neural network architectures, forward propagation, backpropagation, and training processes in a hands-on manner.

## Getting Started with TiNNy

Start using TiNNy by setting up the project on your personal computer. Follow these simple steps to get started:

### Installation

Begin by cloning the TiNNy repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rodmarkun/tiNNy
cd tiNNy
```

Next, ensure all necessary Python dependencies are installed:

```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

### Dive Into Demos

TiNNy comes equipped with two sample Python notebooks. These demos are a great way to see TiNNy in action:

- `demo_classification.ipynb`: TiNNy classification project using the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.
- `demo_regression.ipynb`: TiNNy regression project using the Boston housing price dataset.
